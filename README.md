Image Filtering-

Image filtering refers to the process of modifying or enhancing
an image by applying various mathematical operations or algorithms
to it. The purpose of image filtering is to remove noise or unwanted
features from the image or to highlight certain aspects of the image.

Types of filters-

There are several types of filters used in image filtering, including:
Median filter: A type of nonlinear filter that replaces each pixel
with the median value of its neighborhood.

Gaussian filter: A type of linear filter that convolves the image
with a Gaussian function to blur the image and reduce noise.

Mean filter: A type of linear filter that replaces each pixel with
the average value of its neighborhood.

Bilateral filter: A type of nonlinear filter that smoothes an image
while preserving edges by considering both spatial and range differences.

Laplacian filter: A type of linear filter that enhances edges and highlights
fine detail by detecting the edges in an image.

Sobel filter: A type of linear filter that is used for edge detection and 
image gradients in both the x and y directions.

Canny filter: A type of edge detection filter that uses a multi-stage
algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in an image.

Wiener filter: A type of linear filter that reduces noise and enhances
image quality by minimizing the mean square error between the filtered
image and the original image.

Wavelet filter: A type of filter that decomposes an image into different
frequency sub-bands and applies different filters to each sub-band.

These filters can be used alone or in combination with other filters
to achieve specific image processing goals such as smoothing, sharpening, noise reduction, edge detection, and feature extraction.
